msp-data
======

This is an experimental project intended to leverage the Scottish Parliament's
open data service. The intention is to display as much of the publicly accessible
data on MSPs from these APIs as possible in a clean format and with no backend.

I'm intentionally avoiding JQuery, React etc. as this is meant to be a learning
project rather than a full scale application.
