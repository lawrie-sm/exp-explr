MSP Data
======

A small web app which presents MSP information from the  Scottish Parliament's [open data service](https://data.parliament.scot/#/home).

This is an experimental / learning project. The intention here is to explore how to leverage the Parliamentary APIs and how they fit together. I also wanted to use ES6 alone, without a view engine, for learning purposes.

The project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. Scottish Parliament open data contains information licenced under the [Scottish Parliament Copyright Licence](http://www.parliament.scot/Fol/Scottish_Parliament_Licence.pdf).
