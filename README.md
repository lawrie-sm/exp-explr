MSP Data
======

This is a frontend application using the Scottish Parliament's [open data 
service](https://data.parliament.scot/#/home).

This is still in active development. The goal is to present users with a 
groupable and sortable list of MSP cards. Clicking on the card will 
give more information on each MSP. The information itself is kept up to date by the Scottish Parliament.

The project is not affiliated with or endorsed by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body.
